# üíº SAL_BW_Project ‚Äì Job Descriptions Analysis

## üìå Project Overview  
This project focuses on analyzing job description data to derive meaningful insights. It includes:
- Downloading the dataset from Kaggle  
- Cleaning and preprocessing the data  
- Loading the cleaned data into SQL  
- Performing SQL-based analysis  
- Conducting Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualizations  

---

## üîÑ Project Workflow

### 1. *Data Cleaning*  
- Cleaned the dataset using *Pandas*  
- Extracted relevant columns  
- Saved the cleaned data as clean_job_descriptions.csv  

### 2. *SQL Insights*  
- Loaded cleaned data into *SQL Workbench* using a connection setup  
- Executed queries to extract insights:  
  - Most common job titles  
  - Count of jobs per location  
  - Jobs with salary >10 LPA  
  - Frequently hiring companies  

### 3. *EDA & Visualization*  
Used Python libraries (e.g., Matplotlib, Seaborn, WordCloud) to explore and visualize:  
- Jobs by location  
- Salary ranges  
- Trends in job postings  
- Common keywords in job titles

## üìÅ Dataset  
*File:* clean_job_descriptions.csv (https://drive.google.com/file/d/1KY-_3MoRYHhgqOorH-PcX4KVy3sciq0f/view?usp=sharing)

*Columns:*  
- Title: Job title  
- Company Name: Hiring company

## ‚öô How to Run the Project

1. *Data Loading & Cleaning*  
   - Download job_descriptions_not_clean.csv from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ravindrasinghrana/job-description-dataset)
   - Load and clean data using Pandas  
   - Save cleaned file as clean_job_descriptions.csv  

2. *SQL Setup*  
   - Create a database and empty table in SQL Workbench  
   - Use 2 - SQL_Connection script to connect Jupyter to SQL  
   - Import cleaned data into SQL  

3. *SQL Analysis*  
   - Run 3 - SQL_Analysis notebook  
   - Perform queries to generate job market insights  

4. *EDA & Visualization*  
   - Run 4 - EDA Data Visualization notebook  
   - Generate visualizations:  
     - üìä Bar chart: Top job locations  
     - ‚òÅ Word cloud: Common keywords  
     - üì¶ Box plot: Salary distribution  
     - üìà Trend chart: Job postings over time  

---

## üîç Insights from Analysis  
üìç Count of Jobs per Location calculated and visualized job posting counts across locations to identify metro city dominance.

üí∞ Salary Distribution by Range categorized average salaries into defined brackets to understand the spread of compensation levels.

üì¶ Most Common Keywords in Job Titles extracted the top 10 recurring words in job titles to identify high-demand roles and skills.

üåÜ Top 10 Locations for Jobs plotted the top cities by number of job postings, highlighting regional hiring trends.

üîë Top Keywords in Job Titles (Bar Plot) visualized the frequency of popular keywords to emphasize recurring roles and industry trends.

üìâ Salary Outliers Detected created a boxplot to identify outliers and understand salary variation among job listings.

üóì Daily Job Posting Trends converted and grouped posting dates to reveal patterns in job posting frequency¬†over¬†time.
